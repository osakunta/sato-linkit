# SatO Linkit

Can add docs later, but this project uses Next, Tailwind, ShadCN, next-auth(google 0auth), and firebase. 

The google 0auth and firebase are on my personal accounts rn. Should probably be updated before deployment.

To generate NEXTAUTH_SECRET you can just do 

```
openssl rand -base64 32
```

NEXTAUTH_URL is just whatever url you are routing to.
